= tidypics plus for elgg 2.0+ =

extends the well known tidypics plugin for image galleries - adding new features and style.

== 1. Features ==

adds the following to tidypics:

* lists of image galleries are displayed using a vertical masonry effect provided by the isotope plugin. this means that gallery items are loaded into the list dynamically, using jquery and are displayed in an attractive way.
* lists of images are loaded using a justified-gallery jquery plugin which means that they are automatically arranged on the page in such a way that there are no irregular gaps between them and their full aspect ratio is visible, rather than having them cropped into squares as they are by default in elgg.
* an ajax popup lightbox is used to view individual images. the popup includes a jquery slider that displays the other imags in the gallery that contains the current item and also allows comments to be added to the image via ajax. (requires elgg_slider plugin for elgg and galliComments plugin for elgg).
* river items also open the ajax popup lightbox for tidypics images.
* supports hypeLists to load new galleries/images on list pages via ajax.
